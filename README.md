3. Simulation/benchmarking projects 
Produce   a technical report on your findings to date   and   how your findings are   critical   to the vehicle’s   performance. You   need   to   state   your   inputs   into   your   analysis   and   justify   the   values   you have   used.   If   you   are   using   software   as   part   of   your   work, you   must   present   an   overview   of   how    the   software   works   from   the   inputs   to   the   outputs.
4. Cooling 
At   current   you   have   designed   for   manufacture   very   low   quantities   (one)   . As   part   of   the   remit   for Formula Student cost report you   must give   consideration for an annual production of   1000 units       per   year   (S4.7.1)   . You   must   consider   production   methods   suitable   to   manufacture   the   required number   of   parts   (ducting   and   heat   exchanger) and   justify   your   choice. You   must   reflect   the   cost   of the   entire   build   of   the   cooling   system   (heat   exchanger,   pump, air   ducting   and   piping)   . This   might       include   mould   making,   mould   preparation,   body forming, trimming,   painting, fitting, etc. 
You   will   submit   a   small   technical   report   (c.1000 words) comparing   the   cost   of   manufacture   of   the RP   parts   verses代 写6055MAA Motorsport Product InnovationProlog
